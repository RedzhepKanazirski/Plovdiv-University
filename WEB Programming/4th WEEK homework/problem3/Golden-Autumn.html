	<p class="paragraph1">Bulgaria is one of the biggest rose-oil producers in the world and a country that has been closely related to the beautiful flower for centuries. The Rose Valley is the area where the biggest rose plantations and the main rose-oil facilities are located. Every year in June, a month-long Rose Festival takes place there, one of the best times for nature and culture lovers to visit Bulgaria.
	The Rose Valley is not only dedicated to the flowers. This is where one of the biggest Thracian kingdoms was located with a host of tombs to be visited.

	<p class="paragraph1">The Memorial House of the Bulgarian Communist Party sits on Buzludzha Peak, high up in the mountains of Bulgaria. It was opened in 1981, as a citizen-funded tribute to the socialist movement in Bulgaria – but since the country's transition to democracy it has lain abandoned. Today Buzludzha has admirers around the world.
    Curious visitors travel thousands of miles to see it for themselves, and the monument has often been described as one of the most beautiful – and unusual – abandoned places on the planet.</p>
