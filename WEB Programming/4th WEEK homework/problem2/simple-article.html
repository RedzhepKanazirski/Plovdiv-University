	<p>Three workers at a North Carolina assisted living home have been arrested following allegations that they were running a fight club–style operation made up of elderly patients with dementia. Tonacia Yvonne Tyson, 20, Taneshia Deshawn Jordan, 26, and Marilyn Latish McKey, 32, were arrested on assault charges earlier this month, a spokesperson for the Winston-Salem Police Department told BuzzFeed News. The eldercare facility, called Danby House, specializes in caring for patients with Alzheimer's, according to their website. Police said the three Danby House employees were allegedly encouraging the residents to physically fight each other. In at least one case, one of the employees allegedly assaulted a resident by shoving them. The workers also filmed the fights and egged the residents on, police told BuzzFeed News.</p>
    <p>One or more of the workers can reportedly be heard saying, “Punch her in the face" and “Stop screaming, (expletive)" in the video. Another reportedly asked if someone was filming the fight and if the video could be sent to her. One of the elderly women reportedly choked the other, causing one of the workers to say, “You’re making her turn red." The workers allegedly did not intervene. In an interview with police, one of the arrested women reportedly said the woman who was pushed and choked in the fight was a “pain the butt" and that's why they filmed it.For more--><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/dementia-nursing-home-fight-club-three-arrested-danby-house">Click here</a></p>
